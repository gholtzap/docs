The `WeekCal` component provides a **weekly calendar view** that organizes events across a full week. It displays events in two categories: all-day events and timed events. Users can navigate between weeks using the previous, next, and today controls. Additionally, selecting an event opens a dialog with detailed event information.

## Props

### `events: Event[]`

- **Type:** `Event[]`
- **Description:** An array of <Link href="/types/Event">Events</Link>.
- **Event Object Requirements:**
  - Refer to the <Link href="/types/Event">Event</Link> page for more details on the event object structure.

### `size?: CustomSize` (optional)

-   **Type:** `object`
-   **Shape:** `{ width?: string; height?: string; }`
-   **Description:** An optional object to control the calendar's dimensions.
    -   `width`: Sets the overall width of the calendar container (e.g., `'100%'`, `'800px'`).
    -   `height`: Sets the overall height of the calendar container (e.g., `'600px'`, `'80vh'`). 
        - If a `height` is provided, the main calendar grid area becomes vertically scrollable within this height. If omitted, the grid defaults to a fixed height (currently `800px`).
