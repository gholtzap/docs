The `YearCal` component provides a **yearly calendar view** that offers an overview of the entire year divided into monthly segments. With this component, users can click on a specific month to view its details in a month view or select a day to access a day view (currently under construction). The component internally manages view transitions and leverages `date-fns` for robust date manipulation.

## Props

### `initialDate?: Date`

- **Type:** `Date` (optional)
- **Description:** The starting date for the calendar. If not provided, it defaults to the current date.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use the `YearCal` component:

```jsx
'use client'

import React from 'react';
import { YearCal } from 'solisa-calendar';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <YearCal />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
