The `MonthCal` component provides a **monthly calendar view** that displays events organized by day. It renders a full month grid (including overflow days from adjacent months) and supports both larger screen and mobile layouts. Users can click on a day to view its events, which are displayed in a popover for days with multiple events.

## Props

### `events: CalendarEvent[]`

- **Type:** `CalendarEvent[]`
- **Description:** An array of events that follow the <Link href="/types/Event">Event</Link> type. The component uses each event's start date to place it correctly within the monthly grid.
- **Note:** Ensure that each event's date is provided in a format compatible with `date-fns` (e.g., ISO string) for proper parsing.

## Usage Example

Below is an example of how to use the `MonthCal` component:

```jsx
'use client'

import React from 'react';
import { MonthCal } from 'solisa-calendar';
import { events } from '@/app/temp/sampledata';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <MonthCal events={events ?? []} />
    </>
  );
};

export default App;
